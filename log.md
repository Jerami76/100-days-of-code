# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0-3: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Coded at least an hour a day each day. Worked on seting a template for Tribute project.

**Thoughts:** Didn't know if I wanted to puplicly commit to #100DaysofCode. So, I did the work but didn't know how to use GitHub and figured that part may be too difficult. I later decided that if I'm going to do it, I should participate in all aspects. I'm backdating this from Day 11. But, I have been committed and going strong, as eveidenced by the rest of the log. Now back to coding and learning!

 ### Day 4: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Tribute Project for @freecodecamp. Then I decided to start again, now that I've practiced a bit.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Starting fresh made it a lot easier to get my thoughts in order.

### Day 5: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Tribute Project(take 2) for @freecodecamp. Project completed to fulfill requirements. I'm still having a bit of an issue with images exceeding the size of their containing div. Came up with a partial solution, which works to a certain size then gets off-centered when it gets too small. I'll fix that later tonight, then be done with the project and move on. Also did a bunch of exercises on W3Schools(HTML) and most were easy but, learned a bunch of things that were only skimmed on freeCodeCamp. So, I'll be doing exercises on both for a bit.

**Thoughts:** Still want to get image sizes down before I move too far but, I feel like things are starting to click. I've also been trying to make sure to follow things of coding interest on Twitter. Also, reading at least one "article" and watching one video, per day, is becooming useful, as far as helping me to be immersed.

### Day 6: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Tribute Page(final) Added a media query to change the font on small screens and fixed padding. Converted from fixed units to relative units. Started my Survey Form Challenge. Starting out with Grid for the layout. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like responsiveness is clicking. I may be taking a bit more time than some people but, I want to really understand what I'm doing. Having it just work is not enough. I've been immersing myself more fully. I'm trying to watch and read tech content. Trying to keep active on Twitter. Also tightening my web security, since I should act like a Dev. Fake it until you make it!

### Day 7: January 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Coded enough of my Survey Form(Challenge 2) an free code camp to pass all tests, in a little over an hour. Had top look up things that I had only studied and never used but, I learned a ton! I has NO CSS or styling yet. I wanted to make sure all the elements were in there fisrt. Next, I'm going to lay them out tomorrow eith Grid, I think, so I can get some experience with that. Then maybe a last day styling it. 3 more projects to go for the certification! I'd like to do them by the end of the week. Final drafts won't be possible but, I may be able to pass all tests and get them set up for styling, gaining my certificate and having templates that I can style at my leisure.

**Thoughts:** Didn't code any responsiveness today but, took part in a few good coding discussions, watched a video on Grid, which I can't wait to use in the AM. Also, accessibility is apparently an issue for a lot of people. Got into an arguement I shouldn't have. I just need o let people be as wrong as they'd like and follow best practices myself.

### Day 8: January 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Added Grid to my Survey Form Challenge to set up the layout. Added media query to change layout for mobile. Tested and working so far.

**Thoughts:** Grid is really starting to click. My new workflow of adding elements, laying them out then styling, has been working so far.

### Day 9: January 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started a bit late, after midnight. But, once I started I began styling my Survey form. Since it's based opn Amazon Mechanical Turk,I'm trying to style it after Amazon's stylesheet. I'm happy so far. About halfway through styling. Taking a bit of a break then getting right back on it.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot by trying to emulate someone else's style without using their code, just their colors for reference, and their font.(Because searching to match a font is tedious and inefficient.) I'm annoyed with myself for letting life get in the way of my commitment to the challenge today. I've re-committed myself!

### Day 10: January 26, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Played a few silly games to practice CSS Grid/Flex. Fixed some issues with the mobile version of my survey form. Added Amazon logo to show the relationship to color palette. Added more content. Fixed copyright issue by moving it to a different container. I feel it's completed and submitted but, I can continue to find more things I'd like to add and fix. So, I'm moving on and will update every few days, rather than focus on that, as I'm still learning. Added Notepad++ and set it up. Began using it. Installed Git, will need to learn more about it. Spent 20 hours today behind the pc. Not muchcompleted relative to the time but progress, none the less.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting near the point where I have a pretty good grasp on CSS grid and will work on Flex more tomorrow. I need to complete KeePass set up. Also need to organize email. Things are piling up but, I need to keep making slow progress on all fronts while completing one task a day?(maybe?) Talked a lot about code today with anyone who would listen. Immersion was good but I also need to be mindful of all obligations.

### Day 11: January 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent a few more hours working on a few touch-ups to my form. Justified content while keeping titles separate. Much Better design. Started my next project(Product Landing Page). I think the form is very close to being completely complete. I know that now that I've got everything all set, I could use a Nav Bar and More links in the footer. Won't do the footer because I think I'll just do a footer template on current project and backfill it to the form later

**Thoughts:** Posting this a bit early, for me, because I missed a day in the log. I don't want to forget again and I have put in an hour(4 actually. So, if I end up coding overnight, I've already logged. Also, forgot to start on Day 0.(Hold-over from being a non coder.) So, I've adjusted Day #'s accordingly.

### Day 12: January 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a grid template for no reason but, practiced grid a ton. Wanted to have it down and now, on to flexbox.
May be more progress later.

**Thoughts:** Another long overnight of coding. I think flexbox is going to be easier. I'm starting to get the syntax down. I took a day off from freeCodeCamp challenges but, I feel I learned a ton more by stopping for a day. I'm going to take a little break, then the rest of the day I'm going to go back to FCC and learn a little, then work that challenge. Product landing page, here I Come. Tome to get some Flex in!

### Day 13: January 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my product landing page. Made a few shapes in css. Read a lot today! I learned a lot about css, then spent hours on a botom margin.

**Thoughts:** Should maybe have spent some time on revieww. I may after this product landing page. Part of my trouble is deciding what to do for "faux" products or websites. I thinkI need to stick with what I know. Also, put in some time on MTurk. Need to try and balance things. I can go fast but, there's no deadline. Some days, it's okay to only code an hour.

 ### Day 14,15: January 30,31, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I got a mentor/code partner who knows html, css and js. Spent lots of time setting up VSCode, and then learning how to use it properly. I was trying to avoid learning an editor because, as I suspected, it ate up a day and I only barely know it's functions. I have gotten to the point that I can produce code on it and understand most of what I'm seeing. Got that set then started coding my product landing page. I got some content loaded into it. I figured out my flex bar, even though I didn't really need Flex in that situation, it was still a good exercise.

**Thoughts:** Getting a mentor I think will help. I need to work at my job a bit more. Starting to go broke learning to code. I need to figure out a balance. I just think that if I hadn't immersed myself for 2 weeks, I wouldn't have figured out nearly anything. So, I did sacrifice. But, now to balance the 2. Also, need to stop trying to post right before midnight on Twitter, and update this log. I end up missing one or the other or get confused what day I last posted, since it's so close to midnight. Tomorrow, I'm going to set aside some time to learn how to use git and git hub properly.

### Day 16: February 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the morning trying to learn Git from the command line. I was using it but, it was hard to see what was going on. Thanks to my mentor for pointing me in the right direction( GitLens for VSCode, for a start). Worked on my Product Landing page project. Probably could have finished it if I were more on the ball. Need to get Git figured out once and for all tonight!

**Thoughts:** Having a Mentor is really helping. It's good to have someone to show me the right direction for my energy. I need to be more productive when coding. I'm trying to get the tools set up to do that.

< ### Day 17: February 2,3 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up accounts and a bit on my product Landing page. I've been organizing my code as well. Not much new but, I cleaned up old code.

**Thoughts:** I should get right on coding. I did take it a bit lighter on coding but, more than a few hours behind the pc both days. More tomorrow.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
