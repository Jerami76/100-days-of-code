# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0-3: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Coded at least an hour a day each day. Worked on seting a template for Tribute project.

**Thoughts:** Didn't know if I wanted to puplicly commit to #100DaysofCode. So, I did the work but didn't know how to use GitHub and figured that part may be too difficult. I later decided that if I'm going to do it, I should participate in all aspects. I'm backdating this from Day 11. But, I have been committed and going strong, as eveidenced by the rest of the log. Now back to coding and learning!

 ### Day 4: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Tribute Project for @freecodecamp. Then I decided to start again, now that I've practiced a bit.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Starting fresh made it a lot easier to get my thoughts in order.

### Day 5: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Tribute Project(take 2) for @freecodecamp. Project completed to fulfill requirements. I'm still having a bit of an issue with images exceeding the size of their containing div. Came up with a partial solution, which works to a certain size then gets off-centered when it gets too small. I'll fix that later tonight, then be done with the project and move on. Also did a bunch of exercises on W3Schools(HTML) and most were easy but, learned a bunch of things that were only skimmed on freeCodeCamp. So, I'll be doing exercises on both for a bit.

**Thoughts:** Still want to get image sizes down before I move too far but, I feel like things are starting to click. I've also been trying to make sure to follow things of coding interest on Twitter. Also, reading at least one "article" and watching one video, per day, is becooming useful, as far as helping me to be immersed.

### Day 6: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Tribute Page(final) Added a media query to change the font on small screens and fixed padding. Converted from fixed units to relative units. Started my Survey Form Challenge. Starting out with Grid for the layout. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like responsiveness is clicking. I may be taking a bit more time than some people but, I want to really understand what I'm doing. Having it just work is not enough. I've been immersing myself more fully. I'm trying to watch and read tech content. Trying to keep active on Twitter. Also tightening my web security, since I should act like a Dev. Fake it until you make it!

### Day 7: January 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Coded enough of my Survey Form(Challenge 2) an free code camp to pass all tests, in a little over an hour. Had top look up things that I had only studied and never used but, I learned a ton! I has NO CSS or styling yet. I wanted to make sure all the elements were in there first. Next, I'm going to lay them out tomorrow with Grid, I think, so I can get some experience with that. Then maybe a last day styling it. 3 more projects to go for the certification! I'd like to do them by the end of the week. Final drafts won't be possible but, I may be able to pass all tests and get them set up for styling, gaining my certificate and having templates that I can style at my leisure.

**Thoughts:** Didn't code any responsiveness today but, took part in a few good coding discussions, watched a video on Grid, which I can't wait to use in the AM. Also, accessibility is apparently an issue for a lot of people. Got into an arguement I shouldn't have. I just need o let people be as wrong as they'd like and follow best practices myself.

### Day 8: January 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Added Grid to my Survey Form Challenge to set up the layout. Added media query to change layout for mobile. Tested and working so far.

**Thoughts:** Grid is really starting to click. My new workflow of adding elements, laying them out then styling, has been working so far.

### Day 9: January 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started a bit late, after midnight. But, once I started I began styling my Survey form. Since it's based opn Amazon Mechanical Turk,I'm trying to style it after Amazon's stylesheet. I'm happy so far. About halfway through styling. Taking a bit of a break then getting right back on it.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot by trying to emulate someone else's style without using their code, just their colors for reference, and their font.(Because searching to match a font is tedious and inefficient.) I'm annoyed with myself for letting life get in the way of my commitment to the challenge today. I've re-committed myself!

### Day 10: January 26, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Played a few silly games to practice CSS Grid/Flex. Fixed some issues with the mobile version of my survey form. Added Amazon logo to show the relationship to color palette. Added more content. Fixed copyright issue by moving it to a different container. I feel it's completed and submitted but, I can continue to find more things I'd like to add and fix. So, I'm moving on and will update every few days, rather than focus on that, as I'm still learning. Added Notepad++ and set it up. Began using it. Installed Git, will need to learn more about it. Spent 20 hours today behind the pc. Not muchcompleted relative to the time but progress, none the less.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting near the point where I have a pretty good grasp on CSS grid and will work on Flex more tomorrow. I need to complete KeePass set up. Also need to organize email. Things are piling up but, I need to keep making slow progress on all fronts while completing one task a day?(maybe?) Talked a lot about code today with anyone who would listen. Immersion was good but I also need to be mindful of all obligations.

### Day 11: January 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent a few more hours working on a few touch-ups to my form. Justified content while keeping titles separate. Much Better design. Started my next project(Product Landing Page). I think the form is very close to being completely complete. I know that now that I've got everything all set, I could use a Nav Bar and More links in the footer. Won't do the footer because I think I'll just do a footer template on current project and backfill it to the form later

**Thoughts:** Posting this a bit early, for me, because I missed a day in the log. I don't want to forget again and I have put in an hour(4 actually. So, if I end up coding overnight, I've already logged. Also, forgot to start on Day 0.(Hold-over from being a non coder.) So, I've adjusted Day #'s accordingly.

### Day 12: January 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a grid template for no reason but, practiced grid a ton. Wanted to have it down and now, on to flexbox.
May be more progress later.

**Thoughts:** Another long overnight of coding. I think flexbox is going to be easier. I'm starting to get the syntax down. I took a day off from freeCodeCamp challenges but, I feel I learned a ton more by stopping for a day. I'm going to take a little break, then the rest of the day I'm going to go back to FCC and learn a little, then work that challenge. Product landing page, here I Come. Tome to get some Flex in!

### Day 13: January 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my product landing page. Made a few shapes in css. Read a lot today! I learned a lot about css, then spent hours on a botom margin.

**Thoughts:** Should maybe have spent some time on revieww. I may after this product landing page. Part of my trouble is deciding what to do for "faux" products or websites. I thinkI need to stick with what I know. Also, put in some time on MTurk. Need to try and balance things. I can go fast but, there's no deadline. Some days, it's okay to only code an hour.

 ### Day 14,15: January 30,31, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I got a mentor/code partner who knows html, css and js. Spent lots of time setting up VSCode, and then learning how to use it properly. I was trying to avoid learning an editor because, as I suspected, it ate up a day and I only barely know it's functions. I have gotten to the point that I can produce code on it and understand most of what I'm seeing. Got that set then started coding my product landing page. I got some content loaded into it. I figured out my flex bar, even though I didn't really need Flex in that situation, it was still a good exercise.

**Thoughts:** Getting a mentor I think will help. I need to work at my job a bit more. Starting to go broke learning to code. I need to figure out a balance. I just think that if I hadn't immersed myself for 2 weeks, I wouldn't have figured out nearly anything. So, I did sacrifice. But, now to balance the 2. Also, need to stop trying to post right before midnight on Twitter, and update this log. I end up missing one or the other or get confused what day I last posted, since it's so close to midnight. Tomorrow, I'm going to set aside some time to learn how to use git and git hub properly.

### Day 16: February 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the morning trying to learn Git from the command line. I was using it but, it was hard to see what was going on. Thanks to my mentor for pointing me in the right direction( GitLens for VSCode, for a start). Worked on my Product Landing page project. Probably could have finished it if I were more on the ball. Need to get Git figured out once and for all tonight!

**Thoughts:** Having a Mentor is really helping. It's good to have someone to show me the right direction for my energy. I need to be more productive when coding. I'm trying to get the tools set up to do that.

### Day 17,18: February 2,3 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up accounts and a bit on my product Landing page. I've been organizing my code as well. Not much new but, I cleaned up old code.

**Thoughts:** I should get right on coding. I did take it a bit lighter on coding but, more than a few hours behind the pc both days. More tomorrow.

### Day 19: February 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on restarting my product landing page. Decided it was better to restart with leaner code. 

**Thoughts:** I need to plan ahead better, which will come easier when I'm more experienced. Rigth now thoug, any code that works is good. I can always rewrite if needed.

 ### Day 20: February 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on redoing my product page. Decided to scrap again. Want to write it mobile first. Finally figured out what that means. Spent 2 hours working from Git Bash. Trying to set up a correct repo for my project, then creat a branch to style it. It was hard but, I get it now. Checked in with my mentor and talked about how art can be part of my pages. Pretty neat idea. Need to get a graphics tablet. (Maybe I can use my touchscreen?)

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to work mobile first, as that's the new environment. I didn't really understand what that fully meant until today. So, I've coded the markup only. Now I should do the CSS based on mobile configuration as the main css and add my nedia query in reverse to what I had, by writing my media query for larger screens and then everything else will be "mobile first".

 ### Day 21: February 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on investigating SASS/SCSS. Installed and read about Live SASS Compile for VS Code. Had trouble because I'm inexperienced. After 5 hours of reading and trying to get it to work, I realized I needed Ruby. I had no idea Ruby wasn't installed. I had very little idea what Ruby was.Apparently it's a framework that writes(compiles) your CSS from really complex code to a more readable and compatible, nested version.

**Thoughts:** I think I bit off more than I could chew. I had every intention of finishing my product page today but, I got derailed by Ruby on Rails. I'm not nearly comfortable enough with writing media queries to trust them to an extension. Not that I can do better but I need to try and work it out myself.

  ### Day 22: February 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on nothing but watched 1 ruby video. I confirmed my suspicion that I wasn't ready yet. Soon but, I've only made 2.5pages so far. No code yet today but, my brain really lives on PST. So, I get up sometimes at 11 at night, EST, where I live. So, doing my hour isn't always feasible withing the first 45 minutes of waking but, I work overnight. Not every night but most. So it makes posting difficult before the strike of midnight.

**Thoughts:** I need to figure out better times to do things like sleep and post. I'm working on it. Not missed more than a day with posting. I've still coded all days, even yesterday for a bit.

### Day 23: February 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on feeling better from my cold. Worked on some CSS before midnight. Still going.

**Thoughts:** I don't know. I still need to start earlier.

### Day 24: February 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got back on track after connectivity issues. Added box-sizing and Normalize.css to my product landing page. Committed and pushed. Worked on product page, to be completed ASAP.

**Thoughts:** I think that normalized and box-sizing should be defalt browser settings. I think browser "styling" should be an option.

### Day 25: February 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent 4+ hours on FlexZombies 1+ hours on product page. Tranferring in old content from false start. Realized I was only seconds away from completing it the first time. Learned more the second time.


**Thoughts:** Was able to Tweet before midnight but, log post is late. Need to work on being earlier with everything. Still working on work/learning balance.

### Day 26,27: February 16,17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2 solid hours on my product page and made real progress! Fixed navbar and header. Added Overview. Started product box but, that's going to be changed, I think.

**Thoughts:** Missed another day of posting due to an insane sleep schedule but, trying to get better. That said, used a pom timer to put in 2 solid hours and could go for more. I think the 25min increments helps.

### Day 28,29: February 18,19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2 solid hours on my product page and almost finished mobile! Added product boxes, and content. Need to align text(broke for some reason, I think I changed an id. No worries. I'll finish it in the next few hours but, missed yesterdays post and today is already late. Want to at least post so I don't go 2 days without posting or tweeting.

**Thoughts:** AGAIN!!!Missed another day of posting due to an insane sleep schedule but, trying to get better. That said, used a pom timer to put in 2 solid hours and could go for more. I think the 25min increments helps same as last post. Need to figure out why I'm not able to space my product boxes. I think it's because I have a body height set in grid. I can fix that. Also, answered my first code question on Twitter yesterday. That made me feel good.

### Day 30: February 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 4 hours of coding got me to where I really was proud of where I was. Fixed product boxes, margins, layout in general. GOt notes for changes. Tried to publish on gh pages, had trouble linking css.

**Thoughts:** Posting an hour late, even though I had finished coding hours ago. Now to slow down on git. There's something that's not clicking. Also, FCC is not always "Best Practice"

### Day 31: February 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 1 hour of code and 3 hours of trying to fix an error I had made on Git(hub). But, I've figured the things out and am at second draft of Product Landing Page. FIgured out why I was having trouble with gh-pages. Should be no more issues.

**Thoughts:** Posting an 5 hours late, even though I had finished coding 3 hours ago. Finally got gh-pages which made me feel ok. Spent 12 hours Turking so it was a very long day. I should be sleeping and almost awake by now but, instead I've been up for 2 days. Need to figure out a better schedule.

### Day 32: February 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Pretty good day but, you can always learn more! Added a couple of media queries to my Product Landing Page. Could add one more but, could also be okay with it, if my life depended on it. In a perfect world, I'd add one more @media for very large screens(increase font sizes) and wiggle my padding a bit and, in a dream world, resize my images. But, that may be too much work for a project.

**Thoughts:** Finally pushed, updated log and tweeted before midnight! Didn't get much work($) done today but, that's not what this log is about. Still need to find a work/learning balance but, I'm addicted to coding!

### Day 33: February 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Played around with npm and node.js for some background. Spent a lot of time in the command line today, which is good. Submitted a code.pen for my Product Page Project that passes FCC's tests but, isn't as nice as the page that I've have linked at the bottom of this post. Moving on to my next project. A light code day but, still going. Just wanted to post before midnight.

**Thoughts:** Sleep and work are still an issue. Coding isn't as much of one. Feeling blah today.

### Day 34: February 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learning javascript today. That's about it. 4 hours of code challenges.

**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are still an issue.** Stressed a bit today which interfered more than I would have liked but, I realize it and can work on it. Starting to understand js, a bit but need much more practice. I wan to go back to HTML and CSS and do my Technical Doc Page, or do another Product Landing with better ideas but, I know I'll need js and it's okay to get outside my comfort zone. That said, I could continue with HTML and CSS and spend a lifetime there. But, at least a solid understanding of js, regardless of what I use it for, will be important for a career. Not as much as a hobbyist.

### Day 35: February 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: More Learning javascript today. That's about it. 3.5 hours of code challenges. Watched the intro video to 30DaysofJavascript. Coded JS for an hour just by following along. Learned variables and functions on FCC. Some of it is sticking. Someof it will need a good bit of time.

**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are still an issue.** No real stress today, code related. Would have liked to output more. That's why I tried to start 30Daysof Javascript, to do along with my FCC projects but, realized I was way in over my head. I reall need to finish the basics on FCC then use 30Days to learn to apply it in a functional way. I realized I wouldn't have been learning, just copying, which has it's own merit but, not what I wanted. Also realized that that I have a few options in front of me. I could finish my FCC projects for Responsive WebDev slowly, for exactly an hour a day(2poms, 2breaks) and then learn and try to code js for whatever time further that I can dedicate. Writing  it out, this seems like a good idea. I wish I could focus just on javascript for the moment but, I don't want to forget the things I've learned in HTML or CSS. Also, need to make sure to dedicate at least 4 poms, preferably 6, on mTurk. Lots to think about. Taking a break to get my head around it.

### Day 36, 37: February 26, 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned javascript for a couple of hours. Very small amount of code.  Had to focus on the real job. Spending the next few hours coding 
**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are still an issue.** I may give up on trying to be awake during the day. It's not working out and making everything else more difficult. I may just start sleeping whenever and not try and stick to a schedule. Then again, maybe more rigid scheduling is required. Not really sure.

### Day 38: February 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Coded javascript for a couple of hours. Made a javascript Drum Kit. First functional use of javascript.

**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are still an issue. But, I'm not going to stress about sleep anymore.** I have given up on trying to be awake during the day. It's not working out and making everything else more difficult. I may just start sleeping whenever and not try and stick to a schedule. Javascript is hard and I'm trying really hard to get it. I so badly wanted to go back to css but, I NEED to know javascript. Once I have javascript starting to click, I'll then spend some time working on my basic 3.(HTML, CSS, JS)

 ### Day 39: March 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned javascript for 3 hours. No real output but, a bunch of code.

**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are less of an issue. Didn't stress about sleep today.** Javascript is starting to make sense. After functional code yesterday, I went back to the basics. Things seemed to go a lot better and I didn't need to read the instructions to the FCC challenges. That's when css and html started to click as well. So, we'll see where this goes. Going to keep going an post progress on twitter a bit late. Don't want to leave the zone. Once I have javascript really clicking, I'll then spend some time working on my basic 3.(HTML, CSS, JS) Should start Javascript30 to do along with 100DaysofCode. I will in a day or 2. Then I can have some real progress. I sometimes feel like I'm slow or a bad code partner but, I think for under 40 days, I'm doing alright. I know my css skills wer pretty good before and I'll touch them up now that I'm starting to get the hang of interactivity to go along with responsiveness.

 ### Day 40: March 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Javascript all day! Tons of progress on a new project- Todo List. It's made following WatchAndCode with Gordon Zhu. Added variable, and arrays, and functions into methods. I interacted with the functions via the console. I'll add a link to the code once I push it to a remote.

**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are less of an issue. Didn't stress about sleep today.** Javascript is really starting to click. After tons of real "original" code today, I was happy when I was able to pause the video and code ahead, rather than behind. Had a bit of a giggle and an aha moment, when I got something to work before being shown. Can't wait spend some time working on my basic 3.(HTML, CSS, JS) Should soon start Javascript30 to do along with 100DaysofCode after finishing this course. Still another day or 2. Overall, a great day. I'm taking a bit of a break and will do more later.

### Day 41: March 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: More javascript all day! A bunch more progress on my Todo List. Changed my array into an array of objects. Changed my methods to interact with object property values. Learned for loops. Finished v4.0 of the Todo List.(44%) Still going at it but, it' midnight. So, updating. I'll still add a link to the code once I push it to a remote.

**Thoughts:** **Sleep and work are still less of an issue. Didn't stress about sleep today.** Javascript is Getting fun! Can't wait to know a lot so I can make cool stuff! Still sticking to it. Got to hand it to myself for not giving up. Still need to add a better amount of paid work but, sacrifices.

  ### Day 42: March 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Could literally only code for 1 hour. Learned if/else and worked on for loops. Added both to Todo list app. Pushed v5 of TodoList App.

**Thoughts:** **Training for new job gave less time today** Did no real paid work today due to training for a new job. Could only code for an hour but, will code more in the next day. Fun to see that even though I hadn't been taught if/else, I was close when I guessed. Starting to think like a developer.

**Today's Progress**: Learned for 3 hours, coded for 1. Practiced for loops on my Todo List. Added allToggle: to change all .completed to false, if all were true, otherwise, change all to true. Updated to v 6.0 of TodoList.

**Thoughts:** **Training for new job gave less time today[cont.]** Did no real paid work today due to training for a new job. Could only code for an hour but, will hopefully code more in the next day. Still thinkning like a developer. Sill starting to get enough confidence to try and code ahead, even if it's wrong. It usually is.

 ### Day 45: March 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: First full day back. Lots of javascript. Learned about the DOM and interacting with it through javascript. Added HTML to Todo List app to add UI. Added functionality to those buttons by grabbing values from DOM and using them in js. Learned to Debug. v8 Completed and tested. Pushed to gh-pages.

**Thoughts:** **Failed the test. I'm past it. Moving on** [new thoughts] It wasgreat to be coding again. Had a very successful day and plan to keep giong but don't want to post under pressure.

 ### Day 46: March 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: About 4 hours of code and learning javascript. Added view object to TodoList app to display in the DOM. Cleaned comments. Added method for appending li elements and changing textContent. May post more today. 

**Thoughts:** One thing that's interesting to notice when moving from HTML to JavaScript, when you first code HTML you treat your Block Level elements as physical objects. Once you move to JavaScript, you realize that the HTML is just a visual representation of a concept. HTML elements are no more objects than a painting of an apple is an apple. Once you create a JavaScript object, it can be as Faithfully or unfaithfully represented in the HTML as any Apple in a painting.

  ### Day 49: March 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Light output day. Did a few Edabit and FCC challenges and started a new Udemy course on JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Felt great to finish a course yesterday and it's good to start a new one. Excited about my JavaScript studies. Need to work more. Tired of being broke. Will figure out how to work a few hours a day and not have it interfere with my studies.

 ### Day 50: March 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent Day 50 learning and working my way back to HTML/CSS. Coded an eye in pure css, linked below, which was a fun use of my skills. Learned a few things while doing it.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to try and redouble my efforts in learning to code, while also making sure that I work enough to not be broke. I'll start on MTurk tomorrow, then Usertesting the next day.

### Day 51: March 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I researched and taught myself proper webpage file structure(heirarchy). I applied it to my ToDo List app to make it so that I can store images locally(to the page). Installed Paint.NET to allow image editing to resize original images so that they aren't alwyas being resized by css. Added HTML to index on ToDo List to add elements to flesh out the page.

**Thoughts:** I worked for about an hour today. It's hard getting back into the swing of things. Will try more today. Really happy that I got file structure because I feel like it hasn't been mentioned properly and I was always lost as to how/where to put things. I will need more practice but, getting there.

**Today's Progress**: Added toggleCompleted button with functionality to ToDoList app. Reorganized HTML. Just need to add contact section and I can move to styling. Only had an hour or 2 to work on it.

**Thoughts:** I worked for about an hour again. It's hard getting back into the swing of things. Will really try more. It was neat getting my button to work on my own, without following a tutorial, just going by my previous code.

### Day 53, 54, 55: March 20, 21, 22 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have a second to update my log and, rather than try to add multiple daily updates retroactively, I'm adding 3 days here. Day 53, I learned and switched from css to Sass(.scss) to use a more advanced scripting language. Added Sass stylesheet to my Todo List but, didn't get to do much styling. Day 54, I added a splash page to my Todo List app and got the HTML written. Days 54 and 55, I added Sass to the splash page, it uses variables to make it reusable. Working on animation next.

**Thoughts:** Busy days. Felt a bit overwhelmed. Still trying to get more paid work done. Nice to go back and learn some Sass, to level up my css. Finishing with this today, hopefully. Then I'll move back to complete Responsive webdev cert on FCC.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
