# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 5: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Tribute Project for @freecodecamp. Then I decided to start again, now that I've practiced a bit.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Starting fresh made it a lot easier to get my thoughts in order.

 ### Day 6: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Tribute Project(take 2) for @freecodecamp. Project completed to fulfill requirements. I'm still having a bit of an issue with images exceeding the size of their containing div. Came up with a partial solution, which works to a certain size then gets off-centered when it gets too small. I'll fix that later tonight, then be done with the project and move on. Also did a bunch of exercises on W3Schools(HTML) and most were easy but, learned a bunch of things that were only skimmed on freeCodeCamp. So, I'll be doing exercises on both for a bit.

**Thoughts:** Still want to get image sizes down before I move too far but, I feel like things are starting to click. I've also been trying to make sure to follow things of coding interest on Twitter. Also, reading at least one "article" and watching one video, per day, is becooming useful, as far as helping me to be immersed.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
